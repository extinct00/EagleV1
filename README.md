## Low-cost split column-staggered ergonomic keyboard
A Corne-like split keyboard with a little bit wider thumb-cluster and more agressive pinky stagger. This keyboard is designed to be compatible with RedDragon LowProfile switches that are widely avaialable on AliExpress for very cheap. They have the same height as
Khail LP switches (around 12mm) and can be used with classic MX style keycaps, although some might hit the upper housing. Preffered are any keycaps compatible with Numphy keyboards or any 3D printed, either FDM or SLA.

## Introduction
This project is designed to create a split ergonomic keyboard that is both low-cost and low-profile. The keyboard is split into two halves, allowing for a more natural hand position and reducing strain during long typing sessions. The low-profile design ensures a sleek and modern look while maintaining comfort.

---

## Features
- **Split Design**: Ergonomically designed to reduce strain on your hands and wrists.
- **Low-Cost**: Built with affordable components to keep the project accessible.
- **Low-Profile**: Sleek and compact design for a modern look.
- **Customizable**: Open-source firmware and hardware for easy customization.

## Build Instructions
Below is a step-by-step guide to building your split ergonomic keyboard. (You can fill in the details as you progress.)

### Step 1: Gather All Components
Ensure you have all the components listed in the [Bill of Materials](#bill-of-materials) section.

### Step 2: Prepare the PCB or Handwiring
- If using a PCB, solder the diodes and microcontroller.
- If handwiring, follow the wiring diagram and connect the switches to the microcontroller.

### Step 3: Assemble the Case
- Attach the switches to the case.
- Secure the PCB or handwired assembly into the case.

### Step 4: Connect the Two Halves
- Use a TRRS cable to connect the two halves of the keyboard.
- Ensure the firmware supports split communication.

### Step 5: Flash the Firmware
- Download and flash the firmware to the microcontroller.
- Customize the keymap if needed.

### Step 6: Test the Keyboard
- Connect the keyboard to your computer and test all keys.
- Make adjustments as necessary.
